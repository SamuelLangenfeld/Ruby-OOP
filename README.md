This exercise is from the Odin Project:

I created a command line game of tic-tac-toe for 2 players. Players enter a square and then the program places their piece on the 3x3 grid. If a player has three in a row they win the game.

I later went back and added rspec testing that tests for valid piece placements and win conditions.
